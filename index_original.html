							<!--<h2>SMALL GALAXIES, COSMIC QUESTIONS - II</h2>-->
							<!--<p><h2>Durham (UK), 29th July &ndash; 2nd August 2024</h2>-->
							<h2>Scientific Rationale</h2>
							<p>Dwarf galaxies are unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation processes and testing key cosmological predictions.
								They are the building blocks of more massive galaxies in the current galaxy formation paradigm, and their relatively
								old and metal poor stellar populations give clues to the formation of the first stars and galaxies.
								Despite their low masses, their relatively large dark matter fractions allow us to probe the nature of dark matter on
								small scales. </p>
							<p>Deep photometric and spectroscopic surveys have been key to enhancing our understanding of dwarf galaxies. A large number
								of these entities have been discovered in recent years, pushing the boundary of the faintest galaxies we know of and raise 
								fundamental questions about the formation of first stars and galaxies in the lowest mass dark matter halos. JWST is also 
								revolutionising the field by providing new data on, and discovery of, the counterparts of these faint objects at higher 
								redshifts. In the coming years, progress will only accelerate thanks to to various upcoming surveys and datasets, such as the
								Rubin Observatory, the Roman Space Telescope, and WEAVE. </p>
							<p>On the other hand, theoretical modelling of these galaxies in a cosmological context has been very challenging due to their low mass
								and faint luminosities, not to mention their sensitivities to galaxy formation processes. Despite these challenges, both hydrodynamical 
								simulations and semiempirical + Nbody models have had major advances in recent years allowing more robust predictions for 
								properties of these objects.  </p>
								<hr>
							<p>In this conference, we would like to bring together researchers working on various aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution
								across cosmic time to discuss the recent progress and key open questions and challenges for the upcoming years. In particular,
								we will be covering the following broad areas:
								<ul>
									<li>The role of dwarf galaxies in the formation of Galactic halos. Invited review: <a href="https://www.astro.rug.nl/~ahelmi/dev/" target="_blank">Amina Helmi (Groningen) </a> </li>
									<li>Dwarf satellite population in the Local Group. Invited review: <a href ="https://astromichelle.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Michelle Collins (Surrey)</a> </li>
									<li>Star formation histories, metallicities and stellar populations in dwarf galaxies. Invited review: <a href="https://www.alexji.com/" target="_blank">Alex Ji (Chicago)</a> </li>
									<li>What can dwarf galaxies reveal about the nature of dark matter? Invited review: <a href="https://eonadler.github.io/" target="_blank">Ethan Nadler (USC & Carnegie Observatories) </a> </li>
									<li>The interplay between cosmic reionisation and the formation of dwarf galaxies. Invited review: <a href="https://physics.gatech.edu/user/john-wise" target="_blank">John Wise (Georgia Tech)</a> </li>
									<li>Dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group. Invited review: <a href="https://www.shanydanieli.com/" target="_blank">Shany Danieli (Princeton)</a> </li>
									<li>Dwarf galaxies at higher redshift, advances through JWST. Invited review: <a href="https://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/16033/" target="_blank">Hakim Atek (IAP)</a> </li>
									<li>Upcoming surveys. Invited review: <a href="https://www.risawechsler.com/" target="_blank">Risa Wechsler (Stanford)</a> </li>
									<li>Wrapping up: pressing questions and future prospects. Invited review: <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/c-s-frenk/" target="_blank">Carlos Frenk (Durham) </a> </li>

If you haven't, please get in touch with the organisers as soon as possible. </p>
				<p>The maximum poster size is A1 (portrait with width less than 27 inches). It can be printed on either paper or fabric. 
					Please also create a PDF of your poster to be posted online (e.g., on Slack). </p>


				<h2>Accessibility of talks and posters</h2>
				<p>1. Formatting your presentation:
				<ul>
					<li>Use a consistent layout with clear, simple language.</li>
					<li>Use a large font size (minimum 18 points).</li>
					<li>Prefer simple sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Verdana), avoid all caps, excessive italics, or underlines.</li>
					<li>Combine colour with bold fonts for emphasis and ensure high contrast between text and background.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				    2. During your talk:
				<ul>
					<li>Describe visuals clearly.</li>
					<li>Speak at a moderate pace.</li>
